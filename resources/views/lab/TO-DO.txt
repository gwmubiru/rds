TO-DO
============


Lab Activities:
	1) 	Create work sheet (basically select 22 samples and add 4 fields of test-kit data)
	2) 	Show list of worksheets
			in progress => Has samples without results: i.e test result = NOT_YET_TESTED
			completed	=> All the samples assigned to them have results [POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, INCONCLUSIVE]
	3) 	Upload CSV with results
	4) 	Do repeat tests, if needed
	5) 	Delete whole worksheet (makes its samples available to go on another worksheet)
	6) 	Detach sample from worksheet (makes detached samples available to go on another worksheet)
	7)	Batches ready for dispatch from lab (i.e testing completed and results ready)
