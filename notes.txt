Laravel will install the version based on the active version on php 

Install curl for php 8.1
sudo apt-get install php8.1-curl
install xml for php8.1
apt-get install php8.1-xml
apt-get install php8.1-gd 

to see the installed php extensions
php --ini

to include the auth scaffolding for login
composer require laravel/ui
php artisan ui bootstrap --auth


Each time you add a new resource run
npm run build

To add jquery as module, run
npm install jquery --save-dev

For Laravel, to include it, add the following to resources/js/app.js
import $ from 'jquery';
window.$ = $;

To add datatables as module, run 
npm i laravel-datatables-vite --save-dev

For laravel, to include it, add the following to resources/js/app.js
import 'laravel-datatables-vite';

N.B is you had imported bootsrap, to avoid conflicts, you can turn off bootstrap since laravel-datatables loads also

Since you will use datatables in laravel application, install it in the php app
composer require yajra/laravel-datatables-oracle
